#conv-net-version-3.1.0
=======================

Deep neural network frame (C++ / OpenCV).

To run this code, you should have 
* a cifar-10 dataset( put "cifar-10-batches-bin" where this .md file is, you can get it from [HERE](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html), make sure to download the binary version which suitable for C programs);
* OpenCV 3.0.
* cmake

##Compile & Run
* Compile: 
```
cmake .
make
``` 
* Run: 
```
./cnn3
``` 
##Updates 

* 3-channels images supported.
* Add Dropout;
* Local Response Normalization supported.
* Use log files dig deeper.
* Use second order derivative back-prop to alter learning rate.
* Jul 1: version 3.1.0 released
* **NEW**: Jul.13 OpenCV 3.0 supported, use dft to accelerate convolution

##Layer Config Description 
* For each layer, there is a **layer_name**, a **layer_type**, and a **output_format**.
* There are currently 2 output formats: **matrix** (cv::Mat, CV_64FC1), and **image** (vector of cv::Mat, CV_64FC3).

####Input Layer
* **batch size**: the training process is using mini-batch stochastic gradient descent.

####Convolutional Layer
* **kernel size**: size of kernels for convolution calculation.
* **kernel amount**: amount of kernels for convolution calculation.
* **combine map**: amount of combine feature map, details can be found in [Notes on Convolutional Neural Networks](http://cogprints.org/5869/1/cnn_tutorial.pdf).
* **weight decay**: weight decay for convolutional kernels.
* **padding**: padding before doing convolution.
* **stride**: stride when doing convolution (For "VALID" type of convolution, **result size = (image_size + 2 * padding - kernel_size) / stride + 1)**.

####Fully Connected Layer
* **num hidden neurons**: size of fully connected layer.
* **weight decay**: weight decay for fully connected layer.

####Softmax Layer
* **num classes**: output size of softmax layer.
* **weight decay**: weight decay for softmax layer.

####Non-linearity Layer
* **method**: sigmoid/tanh/relu/leaky_relu.

####Pooling Layer
* **method**: max/mean/stochastic.
* **overlap**: if use overlap pooling.
* **window size**: window size when using overlap pooling.
* **stride**: pooling stride.

####Local Response Normalization Layer
* **alpha**, **beta**, **k**, **n**: see [ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks.pdf).

####Dropout Layer
* **dropout rate**: percentage of zeros when generating Bernoulli matrix.

####Combine Layer
* for implementing GoogLeNet, TODO...

####Branch Layer
* for implementing GoogLeNet, TODO...
